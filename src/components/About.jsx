                        After spending the last decade teaching in the classroom, I have chosen to broaden my abilities and transition into the ever-changing world of tech! 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Teaching special education during the pandemic opened my eyes to all the capabilities of technology, and I became curious to know more about how it worked and what all I could do with it. I quickly realized the possibilities are endless! This excited me, plunging me into a new professional direction. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        While completing a software engineering certification program, I learned  and practiced everything from creating comprehensive and engaging UIs, cleaning up code, communicating with a team, and developing a fully functional web application. Now I feel even more excited to pivot into a career in tech! 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I absolutely love the planning and organization of projects, as well as creating user-centric designs for UIs. Iâ€™ve been working as a freelance web developer, as well as a software engineering intern with a robotics company. This recent experience, paired with my extensive experience in education, has geared me up for any challenge!
